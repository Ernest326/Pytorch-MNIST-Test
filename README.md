# MNIST Pytorch Test

This is a quick little project I made in order to learn how to use pytorch and how to create a simple Convolutional network  

As a dataset I used the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset which is a collection of digits written between 1-9  
The model is trained and tested with this dataset using a collection of tensors and labels  

### Future plans:
- Implement an app that allows the user to draw digits and allow the model to guess the digit in real-time
